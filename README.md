# Parking Lot Management System (FCFS Scheduling)

This project simulates a parking lot system using the **First Come First Serve (FCFS)** scheduling algorithm in Python. It includes vehicle queuing, dynamic parking allocation, time-based billing, and performance statistics like waiting and turnaround times.

---

## Features

- Dynamic parking slot allocation
- Queue management using FCFS
- Billing based on parking duration
- Waiting time and turnaround time tracking
- Gantt chart visualization
- Summary statistics and reports

---

## How It Works

- Vehicles are parked based on arrival time.
- If all slots are occupied, vehicles wait in a queue.
- As a slot becomes free, the next vehicle in the queue is parked.
- Bills are calculated based on parking duration (default Rs 10/hour).
- Average waiting and turnaround time is calculated.
- Gantt chart visually shows waiting and parking time per vehicle.
